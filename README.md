# Data-Structure

This document is something I would like to look back as a reference on the fundamental data structures essential to computer science. It will be written in Python 3. Reasons being the language is very intuitive to follow. I included a list below of all the data structures I will be covering in this repository.

- Array
- Set
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Queue
- Stack
- Deque
- Hashtable
- Heap
- Binary Tree
- Trie
- Graph
